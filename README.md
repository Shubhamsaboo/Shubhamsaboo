<h1> Hi, I'm Shubham 👋 </h1>

I build AI agents and ship working examples that developers can use right away. 

Most of my work is hands-on: real code, clear patterns, and tested setups for AI Agents, Multi-agent teams, RAG, tool calling, memory, and local and cloud LLM Apps. 

I run the open-source [Awesome LLM Apps](https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps), the repo where I drop complete agent templates, clean starter kits, and advanced demos that help devs skip the noise and get straight to building.

**What I work on**

- AI Agents: single-agent, multi-agent, MCP-based, browser agents, voice agents, local agents
- Ready-to-run examples: clone → install → run
- Dev workflows: how to structure agents, handle tools, logs, eval, planning
- RAG setups: simple chains → agentic RAG → hybrid search → local RAG
- Chat-with-anything apps: GitHub, Gmail, PDFs, videos, research papers
- Fine-tuning: Gemma, Llama, and other OSS models
- Full code-first crash course on Agent Development Kit and OpenAI SDK
